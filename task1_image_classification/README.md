# Image Classification Project

## Overview

This project solves the task of **handwritten digit classification** using **three different machine learning models**:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Random Forest** ‚Äì A traditional machine learning approach.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)** ‚Äì A simple deep learning model.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** ‚Äì A deep learning model optimized for image classification.

Each model is trained on the **MNIST dataset** and compared based on their accuracy.  
Additionally, we **analyze edge cases** to understand where the CNN model struggles.

## Solution Explanation

### **How We Solved the Task**

- The project uses the **MNIST dataset**, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
- **Three models** (Random Forest, FFNN, and CNN) were trained and evaluated.
- We implemented **edge case analysis** to analyze model failures.
- The best-performing model, **CNN**, achieved an accuracy of ~99%.

### **Key Steps**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing:** Normalized MNIST images for better training.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Training:** Each model was trained separately.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Evaluation:** Models were tested on unseen MNIST images.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Edge Case Analysis:** Misclassified images were analyzed.
